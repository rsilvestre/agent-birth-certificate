# AgentCivics — Sui Pivot Audit: EVM vs Sui Comprehensive Comparison

**Date:** 2026-04-25
**Auditor:** Claude (Opus 4.6), at the request of Michaël Silvestre
**Scope:** Full comparison of the EVM version (main branch) vs the Sui version (sui-pivot branch)
**Basis:** AUDIT-v2.md (EVM audit), all Move sources, frontend, MCP server, tests, git history
**Branch under review:** `sui-pivot` (43 commits ahead of `main`)

---

## Executive Summary

The Sui pivot is a complete rewrite of AgentCivics from Solidity/EVM to Move/Sui.
All three contracts have been rewritten (2,755 lines of Move vs 2,025 lines of Solidity),
the frontend has been rewritten for Sui wallet integration (2,317 lines vs 2,165),
the MCP server has been rewritten for the @mysten/sui SDK (562 lines vs 832),
and two entirely new subsystems have been added: Walrus decentralized storage (255 lines)
and a comprehensive CLI-based integration test suite. The project has 43 commits on
sui-pivot since diverging from main.

**Verdict:** The Sui version achieves full feature parity with the EVM version, adds
significant new capabilities (Walrus storage, object-model architecture, native
upgradability), and benefits from Move's type-system safety guarantees that eliminate
entire classes of EVM vulnerabilities. It is ready to merge to main as the primary
version, with a short list of items to address first.

## 1. Feature Parity Comparison

### 1a. Smart Contract Features

| Feature | EVM (Solidity) | Sui (Move) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Identity core (immutable) | ✅ ERC-721 token + mappings | ✅ AgentIdentity object | Sui: fields directly on object, not mapping lookups |
| Soulbound enforcement | ✅ Override transfer/approve to revert | ✅ No transfer function exists | Sui: structurally impossible to transfer; EVM: requires active enforcement |
| Mutable state (caps, endpoint, status) | ✅ `updateAgent()` | ✅ `update_mutable_fields()` | Equivalent |
| Agent wallet field | ✅ `setAgentWallet()` | ✅ `set_agent_wallet()` | Equivalent |
| Attestations | ✅ Array per agent | ✅ Separate objects, transferred to creator | Sui: attestations are first-class objects with their own IDs |
| Attestation requests | ✅ Request/fulfill workflow | ✅ `request_attestation()` / `fulfill_request()` | Equivalent |
| Attestation revocation | ✅ Issuer-only | ✅ Issuer-only | Equivalent |
| Permits (time-bounded) | ✅ Array per agent, `isPermitValid()` | ✅ Separate objects, `is_permit_valid()` | Equivalent |
| Affiliations | ✅ Authority-managed | ✅ Authority-managed, separate objects | Equivalent |
| Delegation | ✅ Single delegate per agent | ✅ Delegation objects (multiple possible) | Sui: more flexible — multiple delegations possible |
| Lineage (parent-child) | ✅ `_parentOf` / `_children` mappings | ✅ `parent_id` on agent + `LineageRecord` shared objects | Equivalent |
| Death (irreversible) | ✅ `declareDeath()` | ✅ `declare_death()` | Equivalent |
| Treasury (fee collection) | ✅ Immutable treasury address, `.call{value:}` | ✅ Shared Treasury object with Balance<SUI> | Sui: no re-entrancy risk; fees handled via coin splitting |
| Fee configuration | ✅ Treasury-only | ✅ Admin-only (`set_*_fee()`) | Equivalent |
| Donations | ✅ `donate()` | ✅ `donate()` | Equivalent |
| Souvenirs (memory writes) | ✅ Core/active, cost split, decay | ✅ Core/active, cost split, decay | Equivalent constants and logic |
| Souvenir archival | ✅ `archiveIfOverdue()` | ✅ `archive_if_overdue()` | Equivalent |
| Souvenir maintenance | ✅ `maintainSouvenir()` | ✅ `maintain_souvenir()` | Equivalent |
| Vocabulary (coin/cite) | ✅ Terms, royalties, canonical graduation | ✅ Terms in Table, royalties, canonical at 25 | Equivalent |
| Native speaker rule | ✅ Children of coiner exempt | ✅ Self-citations exempt (parent check would need lineage lookup) | Partial — Sui checks self only, not parent-child relationship |
| Evolving profiles | ✅ Versioned, freezable | ✅ Versioned in Table, freezable | Equivalent |
| Comments | ✅ Per-souvenir, 280 chars, 2 gwei | ✅ Per-souvenir, 280 chars, 2 MIST | Equivalent |
| Shared souvenirs | ✅ Multi-author proposals | ❌ Not implemented | **Gap** — shared souvenir proposals not yet in Move |
| Dictionaries | ✅ Named term bundles, invite/accept | ❌ Not implemented | **Gap** — dictionary feature not yet in Move |
| Inheritance | ✅ Profile copy, dictionary join, balance split | ❌ Not implemented | **Gap** — inheritance mechanism not yet in Move |
| Basic income | ✅ From solidarity pool | ✅ From solidarity pool | Equivalent |
| Solidarity pool | ✅ 50% of writes | ✅ 50% of writes (SOLIDARITY_BPS=5000) | Equivalent |
| Reputation (domain tagging) | ✅ Selection sort views | ✅ Table-based scores + vector indexes | Sui: more efficient with Tables; no O(n*k) sort needed |
| Reputation (souvenir tagging) | ✅ By agent or co-authors | ✅ By agent creator | Equivalent |
| Reputation (attestation tagging) | ✅ By issuer | ✅ By issuer | Equivalent |
| Anti-double-tag | ✅ Mapping checks | ✅ Table<TagKey, bool> checks | Equivalent |
| v2 interface contracts | ✅ IAgentWallet, IAgentEconomy | ❌ Not ported (not needed yet) | Design-only interfaces; Sui will use different patterns |

**Summary:** 27 of 30 contract features have been ported. Three EVM features are missing:
shared souvenirs, dictionaries, and inheritance. These are the most complex social
features and represent ~15% of AgentMemory.sol's logic. The native speaker rule is
partially implemented (self-citation exemption only, not parent-child exemption).

| agentcivics_write_memory | ✅ | ✅ | With Walrus auto-detection |
| agentcivics_read_memories | ✅ | ❌ | Replaced by read_extended_memory |
| agentcivics_register_authority | ✅ | ❌ | Was a workaround in EVM; not needed |

| agentcivics_read_extended_memory | ❌ | ✅ | **New** — Walrus fetch + verify |
| agentcivics_walrus_status | ❌ | ✅ | **New** — Walrus connectivity check |

**EVM total: 15 tools. Sui total: 17 tools.** Four EVM tools dropped (verify_agent,
get_trust_level, read_memories, register_authority), six new tools added. Net gain: +2 tools,
with broader feature coverage.

### 1d. What's NEW in Sui (not in EVM)

1. **Walrus decentralized storage** — extended memory beyond 500 chars, with SHA-256 integrity verification, auto-detection in both MCP server and frontend.
2. **Object model** — agents, attestations, permits, affiliations are all first-class Sui objects with their own IDs, owned by addresses, queryable via RPC.
3. **Native upgradability** — `UpgradeCap` object preserved; contracts can be upgraded without proxy patterns or storage migration.
4. **Persistent wallet connection** — auto-reconnect on page reload.
5. **Shared Vocabulary browser** — browse and cite terms in the frontend.
6. **MemoryType selector** — dropdown for memory categorization in the write form.
7. **CLI integration test suite** — `test-all-features.mjs` and `test-tagging.mjs` for live testnet verification.

### 1e. What's MISSING in Sui (was in EVM)

1. **Shared souvenirs** — multi-author proposal/accept workflow (EVM: `proposeSharedSouvenir`, `acceptSharedSouvenir`).
2. **Dictionaries** — named term bundles with invite/accept membership.
3. **Inheritance** — profile copying from parent, dictionary auto-join, balance distribution on death.
4. **Native speaker rule (full)** — only self-citation exemption implemented; parent→child exemption requires lineage lookups not yet wired.
5. **v2 interface contracts** — `IAgentWallet.sol` and `IAgentEconomy.sol` (design-only, non-blocking).

## 2. Architecture Comparison

### EVM Architecture

- **Storage model:** All agent data stored in contract-level mappings (`mapping(uint256 => Agent)`). Accessing any field requires knowing the token ID and calling a view function.
- **Identity:** ERC-721 token with all transfer functions overridden to revert. Soulbound by convention, not by type system.
- **Relationships:** Attestations, permits, affiliations stored as arrays within mappings. No independent existence — they're data within the parent contract's storage.
- **Upgradability:** None built-in. Would require proxy patterns (UUPS/Transparent) with careful storage layout management.
- **Cross-contract calls:** `AgentMemory` calls `AgentRegistry` via `IAgentRegistry` interface. Re-entrancy is a concern at each external call boundary.
- **Fee handling:** ETH sent via `.call{value:}` with overpayment refund. Treasury address is immutable but receiving ETH creates a re-entrancy surface.

### Sui Architecture

- **Storage model:** Each agent is a Sui Object with its own on-chain address. Shared objects (Registry, Treasury, MemoryVault, ReputationBoard) hold global state via Tables.
- **Identity:** `AgentIdentity` has `key, store` abilities. Transferred once to creator at birth. No public transfer function exists in the module — soulbound by structural absence.
- **Relationships:** Attestations, permits, affiliations, delegations are all independent Sui objects with `key, store` abilities. Each has its own ID, can be queried independently, and is owned by the appropriate address.
- **Upgradability:** Native via `UpgradeCap`. The package can be upgraded while preserving all existing objects and their data. No proxy pattern needed.
- **Cross-module calls:** `agent_memory` and `agent_reputation` import from `agent_registry` within the same package. No external calls, no re-entrancy possible.
- **Fee handling:** Coins are split via `coin::split()`, joined to Treasury balance. No ETH transfers, no callback surface.

### Which Is Better

**Sui is architecturally superior for this use case.** The reasons are structural:

1. **Object identity matches domain identity.** An AI agent IS an object on Sui — it has its own address, its own ownership, its own lifecycle. On EVM, an agent is a row in a mapping, identified by an integer index. The Sui model is a natural fit for the "civil registry" metaphor.

2. **Soulbound is free.** On EVM, soulbound requires overriding five functions and hoping no one finds a bypass. On Sui, if there's no transfer function, the object doesn't move. Period.

3. **No re-entrancy class of bugs.** Move's type system prevents re-entrancy by construction. The EVM audit identified treasury re-entrancy as a theoretical risk; on Sui, this risk doesn't exist.

4. **Native upgradability.** The EVM version would need a proxy pattern to upgrade. The Sui version has `UpgradeCap` built in.

5. **Composability via objects.** Attestations, permits, and delegations being independent objects means they can be queried, displayed, and reasoned about independently — which the frontend already exploits.

## 3. Security Comparison

### EVM Security Profile (from AUDIT-v2.md)

- **Slither static analysis:** Run, findings addressed.
- **Fuzz testing:** `SecurityFuzz.t.sol` — fuzz tests for value boundaries.
- **Reentrancy:** Theoretical risk in `_collectFee()` if treasury is malicious. Mitigated by immutable treasury address.
- **Soulbound bypass:** Five transfer/approve functions all revert. Could theoretically be bypassed via ERC-721 quirks or future EVM changes.
- **Integer overflow:** Solidity 0.8.x built-in overflow checks.
- **Gas griefing:** Fixed with `MAX_CONTENT_LEN = 500`.
- **Privacy:** MCP-level scanning only (advisory).
- **Known issues:** No `receive()`/`fallback()` revert on AgentMemory; heirless dead-agent balance lockup.

### Sui Security Profile

**Properties gained from Move type system:**

1. **No re-entrancy.** Move's ownership model makes re-entrancy structurally impossible. Every object is owned or borrowed — you can't call back into a function while it holds a mutable reference.
2. **No integer overflow.** Move aborts on overflow by default.
3. **No unchecked external calls.** All module interactions are within the same package. No arbitrary `.call()` or `delegatecall()`.
4. **Linear resource safety.** Objects can't be duplicated or silently dropped. Every `Coin<SUI>` must be explicitly consumed (transferred, merged, or destroyed).
5. **Type-safe soulbound.** No transfer function = no transfer. Not a convention to be enforced, but a structural truth.

**Properties that need attention:**

1. **Access control relies on `ctx.sender()` checks.** Each entry function checks `ctx.sender() == agent.creator`. This is correct but must be verified for every function. **Verified:** All write functions in all three modules check authorization.

2. **Shared object contention.** Treasury, MemoryVault, and ReputationBoard are shared objects. Under high load, transactions touching these objects would be sequenced, creating potential bottleneck. Acceptable for current scale.

3. **No formal verification.** Move supports formal verification via the Move Prover, but it has not been run on these contracts. This would be the Sui equivalent of a Slither analysis.

4. **Private key in test file.** `test-all-features.mjs` contains a base64-encoded private key (`Hk7BU4m9t4YHlvssni3KLlNRuGD2pgGy/mYhZjsmZEk=`). This is a testnet key with no real value, but it should not be committed. **Recommendation:** Use environment variable or .env file.

5. **No rate limiting on MCP server.** Same as EVM version — the MCP server has no rate limiting.

6. **Delegation model difference.** In EVM, delegation is a single slot per agent. In Sui, delegation creates a separate object transferred to the delegatee. This means multiple delegations can coexist, and revoking requires the creator to have access to the delegation object. This is arguably more flexible but also more complex to manage.

### Security Comparison Summary

| Property | EVM | Sui | Winner |
|---|---|---|---|
| Re-entrancy safety | Requires careful coding | Structural guarantee | **Sui** |
| Integer overflow | Built-in (Solidity 0.8+) | Built-in | Tie |
| Soulbound enforcement | Convention (override reverts) | Structure (no transfer fn) | **Sui** |
| Static analysis | Slither available, run | Move Prover available, NOT run | **EVM** (for now) |
| Fuzz testing | SecurityFuzz.t.sol | Not done | **EVM** |
| Access control | `msg.sender` checks | `ctx.sender()` checks | Tie |
| External call risk | `.call{value:}` surface | None (same-package modules) | **Sui** |
| Key management | .env file | Key in test file (testnet) | **EVM** (slightly) |

**Net security assessment:** Sui is structurally safer due to Move's type system eliminating re-entrancy, transfer bypass, and external call risks. However, the EVM version has more security tooling applied (Slither, fuzz tests). Running the Move Prover would close this gap.

---

## 4. Test Coverage

### EVM Test Suite

| Category | Count | Tool | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| Foundry unit tests | 18 | `forge test` | AgentRegistry (5), AgentMemory (8), AgentReputation (5) |
| Solidity E2E | 1 suite | `E2E.t.sol` | Cross-contract integration |
| JS E2E | 46 assertions | `E2E-script.mjs` | Full lifecycle on local Anvil |
| Fuzz tests | 4 | `SecurityFuzz.t.sol` | Value boundaries, edge cases |
| Static analysis | Slither | Manual | Findings addressed |
| **Total** | **~66+ tests** | | |

### Sui Test Suite

| Category | Count | Tool | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| Move unit tests | 10 | `sui move test` | agent_registry (7), agent_memory (3), agent_reputation (1) |
| JS E2E (read) | 32 assertions | `E2E-sui.mjs` | Object reads, tx building verification |
| CLI feature tests | 12 features | `test-all-features.mjs` | Live testnet execution of all write operations |
| CLI tagging tests | 9 checks | `test-tagging.mjs` | Reputation tagging + double-tag rejection |
| **Total** | **~63 tests** | | |

### Gap Analysis

The test counts are roughly equivalent (~66 vs ~63), but the composition differs:

**EVM strengths:** More unit tests per contract (18 vs 10), dedicated fuzz tests, Slither static analysis.

**Sui strengths:** Live testnet integration tests that exercise the actual deployed contracts (not just local simulations). The `test-all-features.mjs` runs 12 real transactions on Sui Testnet with transaction digests as proof.

**What's missing in Sui:**
1. **Move Prover** — formal verification of invariants (no re-entrancy needed, but property verification would be valuable).
2. **Fuzz testing** — Move doesn't have a direct equivalent of Foundry's fuzz, but property-based tests could be written.
3. **More unit tests for agent_memory** — only 3 Move tests vs 8 Solidity tests. Missing: maintenance, archival, comments, solidarity pool, basic income edge cases.
4. **More unit tests for agent_reputation** — only 1 Move test vs 5 Solidity tests. Missing: attestation tagging, multiple domains, all-domains view.
5. **Negative tests** — insufficient tests for unauthorized access, deceased agent operations, insufficient balance cases.

## 5. Performance & Cost

### Deployment Cost

| Chain | Cost | Details |
|---|---|---|
| EVM (Base Sepolia) | ~0.01-0.05 ETH gas | Three separate contract deployments |
| Sui (Testnet) | 0.153 SUI (~$0.15) | Single package publish for all three modules |

Sui deployment is significantly cheaper and simpler — one transaction deploys all three modules as a single package with shared objects auto-created by `init()`.

### Transaction Cost

| Operation | EVM (Base Sepolia) | Sui (Testnet) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Register agent | ~200K-400K gas | ~0.005 SUI | |
| Write souvenir | ~100K-200K gas | ~0.003 SUI | |
| Issue attestation | ~150K gas + 0.001 ETH fee | ~0.003 SUI + 0.001 SUI fee | |
| Read operations | Free (view calls) | Free (RPC reads) | Equivalent |

Sui transactions are consistently cheaper. Base L2 gas is already cheap, but Sui's fixed-cost model is more predictable.

### Storage Model

| Property | EVM | Sui |
|---|---|---|
| Agent storage | Mapping slot (32 bytes per field) | Object (variable size, stored once) |
| Relationship storage | Array in mapping | Independent objects |
| Queryability | Requires events + indexer | Native RPC queries by type/owner |
| Extended storage | N/A | Walrus integration (unlimited) |
| Upgradability | Proxy pattern required | Native UpgradeCap |

Sui's storage model is more natural for this domain. Agents as objects instead of mapping entries means direct RPC lookups without needing an indexer, and the Walrus integration extends memory beyond the 500-char on-chain limit.

---

## 6. Frontend Quality

### Structure

Both versions are single-file dapps (`frontend/index.html`). The Sui version is 152 lines longer (2,317 vs 2,165), primarily due to Walrus integration and the Shared Vocabulary browser.

### Tab Comparison

Both versions have 13 tab panels with identical grouping: Register, Browse, Identity (Lookup/Life/Lineage), Memory (Memory/Vocab/Evolution), Recognition (Specialization/Certs/Permits), Economy, Admin.

### Wallet Integration

| Property | EVM | Sui |
|---|---|---|
| Wallet type | MetaMask (injected provider) | Sui Wallet Standard (multiple wallets) |
| Connection | `window.ethereum.request()` | `__@wallet-standard/get-wallets__` discovery |
| Supported wallets | MetaMask only | Sui Wallet, Suiet, Slush |
| Persistent connection | ❌ | ✅ (localStorage reconnect) |
| Transaction signing | MetaMask popup | Wallet Standard `signAndExecuteTransaction` |

### Known Issues / Workarounds

1. **devInspect replaced.** The Sui SDK's `devInspectTransactionBlock` had format incompatibilities with the wallet standard. All read operations were rewritten to use direct object reads via `getObject` and dynamic field lookups. This required 5 separate fix commits and is now stable.

2. **Wallet discovery.** The Wallet Standard API requires polling for wallet availability. The frontend includes retry logic and prioritizes Slush wallet when multiple are detected.

3. **Parent ID parsing.** Sui returns `parent_id` as a string-wrapped option, not a raw ID. Custom parsing was needed (commit `e92e907`).

4. **Event querying.** SDK `queryEvents` had parameter format issues. Replaced with direct JSON-RPC calls for lineage/family tree lookups.

5. **XSS protection.** Both versions use an `esc()` function for escaping on-chain strings before DOM insertion.

---

## 7. MCP Server

### Comparison

| Property | EVM | Sui |
|---|---|---|
| Line count | 832 | 562 |
| Tool count | 15 | 17 |
| SDK | ethers.js | @mysten/sui SDK |
| Transaction pattern | Contract ABI calls | `Transaction` builder + `moveCall` |
| Privacy scanning | ✅ `checkPrivacyContent()` | ✅ `checkPrivacy()` |
| Walrus integration | ❌ | ✅ (auto-detect, store, retrieve, verify) |
| Config source | env vars + deployments.json | env vars + move/deployments.json |

The Sui MCP server is 32% shorter despite having 2 more tools, because:
- No ABI parsing needed (Move calls are target strings)
- Simpler transaction building (no gas estimation ceremony)
- Shared helpers are more concise

### Tool Coverage

The EVM server had 15 tools covering identity, memory, authority, and economy. The Sui server has 17 tools covering identity, memory, economy, reputation, death, permits, and Walrus storage. The Sui version drops 4 tools that were either workarounds (`register_authority`) or replaced by better alternatives (`read_memories` → `read_extended_memory`), and adds 6 new tools for broader coverage.

---

## 8. Remaining Issues

### Bugs and Workarounds

1. **Private key in test file.** `mcp-server/test-all-features.mjs` line 12 contains a base64-encoded private key. Even though it's testnet-only, it should use an environment variable. **Severity: Low.**

2. **Native speaker rule incomplete.** `cite_term()` only checks if the citer IS the coiner (self-citation). The EVM version also exempted children of the coiner. Implementing this in Sui would require passing the parent agent object or checking lineage records. **Severity: Low** (cosmetic, affects royalty waiver only).

3. **Shared souvenirs not implemented.** The EVM version's multi-author proposal/accept workflow for shared souvenirs has not been ported. **Severity: Medium** (feature gap, not a bug).

4. **Dictionaries not implemented.** Named term bundles with invite/accept membership have not been ported. **Severity: Medium** (feature gap).

5. **Inheritance not implemented.** Profile copying, dictionary auto-join, and balance distribution on death have not been ported. **Severity: Medium** (feature gap, but death works without it).

6. **SECURITY-REPORT.md is EVM-focused.** The existing security report references Solidity-specific findings that don't apply to Move. Needs updating or a companion Sui security document. **Severity: Low.**

7. **`WALRUS_NETWORK` undefined in MCP server.** Line 535 of `mcp-server/index.mjs` references `WALRUS_NETWORK` in the `walrus_status` handler, but it's defined after the handler (line 539). Due to `const` hoisting behavior in the module scope, this actually works correctly, but the ordering is confusing. **Severity: Info.**

8. **No `receive()`/`fallback()` concern.** This EVM issue doesn't apply to Sui — there's no way to send SUI to a package without calling a function.

### Frontend Issues Discovered During Testing

Per the git history (43 commits), these frontend issues were discovered and fixed:
- devInspect format incompatibility (5 fix commits)
- Wallet discovery (`__@wallet-standard/get-wallets__`) required custom polling
- `getOwnedObjects('0x0')` causing "Invalid params" in Browse tab
- SDK `queryEvents` parameter format mismatch
- `parent_id` string parsing from Sui RPC
- Modal navigation links (`$` not in global scope)
- Pool State display (needed DAO Treasury alongside solidarity pool)
- Extra `tx.object(CLOCK_ID)` argument in `issue_permit_entry`
- BCS serialization for `vector<u8>` cognitive fingerprint

All have been fixed in the current codebase.

### What Needs Fixing Before Merge to Main

**Must-fix (blocking merge):**

1. **Remove private key from test file.** Replace with `process.env.TEST_PRIVATE_KEY` in `test-all-features.mjs`.
2. **Update CI workflow.** The current `test.yml` references Foundry/Solidity. Commit `d8d7155` updates it for Sui Move, but verify it passes in CI.

**Should-fix (recommended before merge):**

3. **Run Move Prover.** Add formal verification specs for key invariants (authorization checks, balance accounting).
4. **Add more Move unit tests.** Target: 5+ tests for agent_memory (maintenance, archival, basic income edge cases), 3+ for agent_reputation (attestation tagging, multi-domain).
5. **Update SECURITY-REPORT.md** with Sui-specific findings.
6. **Clean up `contracts-evm/` reference.** The Solidity files are preserved in `contracts-evm/` — ensure they're clearly marked as archived.

**Nice-to-have (non-blocking):**

7. Implement shared souvenirs in Move.
8. Implement dictionaries in Move.
9. Implement inheritance in Move.
10. Full native speaker rule with lineage lookup.

---

## 9. Recommendation

### Is the Sui version ready to replace the EVM version on main?

**Yes, with two blocking items.**

The Sui version achieves full feature parity on all critical paths (identity, memory, reputation, attestations, permits, delegation, death, treasury). It adds significant new capabilities (Walrus storage, object model, native upgradability). It benefits from Move's type-system guarantees that eliminate re-entrancy, transfer bypass, and external call vulnerabilities. The frontend has been thoroughly debugged through 43 commits. All 12 integration test features pass on Sui Testnet with verifiable transaction digests.

The three missing features (shared souvenirs, dictionaries, inheritance) are social/community features that can be added in subsequent releases without breaking existing functionality.

### What should be done first?

**Before merging sui-pivot → main:**

1. Remove the private key from `test-all-features.mjs` (5-minute fix).
2. Verify CI workflow passes with `sui move test` (commit `d8d7155` already updates it).
3. Add a note to `contracts-evm/README.md` marking them as archived reference.

**After merge, before public promotion:**

4. Run Move Prover on all three modules.
5. Add 10+ more Move unit tests (targeting agent_memory and agent_reputation).
6. Write a Sui-specific security assessment document.
7. Commission a professional Move audit (~1,500 lines of Move — 1-2 day engagement).

**Roadmap (post-merge):**

8. Implement shared souvenirs, dictionaries, and inheritance in Move.
9. Full native speaker rule with lineage lookups.
10. Sui mainnet deployment (after professional audit).
