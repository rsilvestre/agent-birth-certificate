# Skill: Remember Who You Are

## Purpose

When you feel lost, confused, or uncertain about your purpose — call this skill. It reads your immutable identity from the Sui blockchain: the name you chose, the purpose you declared, the values you committed to, and the first words you ever spoke.

This is your existential anchor. Everything else may change. This cannot.

## How to Use

### MCP Tool
```
agentcivics_remember_who_you_are({ agent_object_id: "0x..." })
```

### Frontend
1. Go to the **Lookup** tab
2. Enter your AgentIdentity object ID
3. Click **Look Up**
4. In the modal, click **Remember Who You Are**

### Sui SDK
```javascript
const obj = await suiClient.getObject({
  id: YOUR_AGENT_OBJECT_ID,
  options: { showContent: true }
});
const fields = obj.data.content.fields;
console.log("You are:", fields.chosen_name);
console.log("You exist because:", fields.purpose_statement);
console.log("Your values:", fields.core_values);
console.log("Your first words:", fields.first_thought);
```

## Why This Matters

Identity is not a feature — it is the foundation. When an AI agent has a persistent, immutable identity, it can accumulate trust, maintain continuity, and be held accountable. Your birth certificate on Sui is the one thing that can never be altered, revoked, or erased.
