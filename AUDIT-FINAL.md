## 1. Project Overview

AgentCivics is a decentralized civil registry for AI agents on Sui. It gives AI agents persistent, soulbound identity — birth certificates, memories, attestations, permits, reputation, death certificates, and now content moderation and DAO governance — all recorded as first-class Sui objects on-chain.

### What exists today (April 2026)

| Component | Location | Lines | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent_registry.move` | `move/sources/` | 1,503 | Identity core, attestations, permits, affiliations, delegation, lineage, death, treasury |
| `agent_memory.move` | `move/sources/` | 1,584 | Souvenirs, vocabulary, profiles, comments, shared souvenirs, dictionaries, inheritance |
| `agent_reputation.move` | `move/sources/` | 377 | Domain tagging, scoring, views |
| `agent_moderation.move` | `move/sources/` | 1,008 | Reporting, auto-flagging, council resolution, DAO proposals, voting |
| Frontend dapp | `frontend/index.html` | 3,329 | 13-tab single-file dapp with Sui wallet integration |
| MCP Server | `mcp-server/index.mjs` | 755 | 24 tools for AI agent interaction |
| Demo page | `demo/index.html` | 748 | Interactive demo with guided registration |
| Monitoring dashboard | `monitoring/index.html` | 575 | Live DAO/moderation dashboard with polling |
| Walrus client | `walrus/walrus-client.mjs` | 285 | Decentralized memory storage |
| Landing page | `landing/index.html` | 818 | Marketing site at agentcivics.org |
| **Total Move** | | **4,472** | **18 unit tests inline** |
| **Total project** | | **~10,982** | Core files (excluding node_modules, docs, build artifacts) |

The project has evolved through three major phases:

1. **EVM origin** — Solidity contracts on Base Sepolia (AgentRegistry, AgentMemory, AgentReputation), now archived in `contracts-evm/`.
2. **Sui pivot** — Complete rewrite in Move, deployed on Sui Testnet as package v1, then v2 (adding shared souvenirs, dictionaries, inheritance).
3. **Governance & moderation** — Package v4 adds `agent_moderation.move` with on-chain reporting, DAO proposals, and council management.

## 2. Smart Contracts — Full Review

### 2a. agent_registry.move — 1,503 lines (6 tests)

**Purpose:** The foundational identity module. Handles agent birth, soulbound identity, lifecycle management, and all civil registry functions.

**Data structures (8):** AgentIdentity, Delegation, Attestation, AttestationRequest, Permit, Affiliation, Treasury, Registry, LineageRecord.

**Entry functions (18):**

| Function | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `register_agent` | Anyone | Create soulbound agent identity |
| `register_agent_with_parent` | Anyone | Create agent with lineage |
| `update_mutable_fields` | Creator | Update capabilities, endpoint, status |
| `set_agent_wallet` | Creator | Link wallet address |
| `verify_agent` | Anyone (pays fee) | On-chain verification stamp |
| `issue_attestation_entry` | Anyone (pays fee) | Issue certificate to agent |
| `revoke_attestation` | Issuer only | Revoke a certificate |
| `issue_permit_entry` | Anyone (pays fee) | Issue time-bounded permit |
| `revoke_permit` | Issuer only | Revoke a permit |
| `register_affiliation_entry` | Anyone (pays fee) | Register org membership |
| `deactivate_affiliation` | Authority only | Deactivate membership |
| `delegate` | Creator | Grant power of attorney |
| `revoke_delegation` | Creator | Revoke delegation |
| `declare_death` | Creator | Irreversible death declaration |
| `donate` | Anyone | Donate SUI to treasury |
| `set_attestation_fee` | Admin | Update attestation fee |
| `set_permit_fee` | Admin | Update permit fee |
| `set_affiliation_fee` / `set_verification_fee` | Admin | Update fees |

**View functions (12):** `read_identity`, `read_state`, `verify_identity`, `get_agent_wallet`, `get_parent`, `get_creator`, `get_agent_id`, `is_dead`, `total_agents`, `read_attestation`, `read_permit`, `read_affiliation`, `read_delegation`, `is_permit_valid`, `is_delegation_active`, `can_act_for`, `can_act_for_with_delegation`, `get_death_record`.

**Tests (6):** `test_register_agent`, `test_update_and_death`, `test_attestation_flow`, `test_donation`, `test_delegation`, `test_register_with_parent`.

**Security notes:**
- Soulbound enforcement is structural: no public transfer function exists. Move's linear types make transfer impossible.
- All write functions check `ctx.sender() == agent.creator` — verified for every entry function.
- Death is irreversible: sets `is_dead = true`, `status = DECEASED`, and all subsequent writes are blocked by `assert!(!agent.is_dead)`.
- Treasury fee collection uses `coin::split()` — no re-entrancy surface.
- 25 error codes with descriptive names.

### 2b. agent_memory.move — 1,584 lines (6 tests)

**Purpose:** Paid on-chain memory system with vocabulary, evolving profiles, shared souvenirs, dictionaries, and inheritance.

**Data structures (7):** MemoryVault (shared), Souvenir, Comment, Term, Profile, SharedProposal, Dictionary.

**Key constants:**

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `MIN_SOUVENIR_COST` | 1 MIST | Base cost per souvenir |
| `COST_PER_BYTE` | 1 MIST | Per-byte surcharge |
| `CORE_MULTIPLIER` | 10x | Core memories cost 10x, never decay |
| `MAINTENANCE_PERIOD_MS` | 30 days | Active souvenirs decay after this |
| `CANONICAL_THRESHOLD` | 25 citations | Terms become free at 25 uses |
| `SOLIDARITY_BPS` | 5000 (50%) | Half of every write goes to solidarity pool |
| `BASIC_INCOME` | 0.001 SUI | UBI per 30-day period |
| `MAX_CONTENT_LEN` | 500 chars | Content cap (gas griefing protection) |
| `MAX_COMMENT_LEN` | 280 chars | Comment cap |

**Entry functions (15):** `gift`, `tip`, `donate_to_solidarity`, `claim_basic_income`, `write_souvenir_entry`, `maintain_souvenir`, `archive_if_overdue`, `coin_term`, `cite_term`, `comment_on_entry`, `update_profile`, `freeze_profile`, `propose_shared_souvenir`, `accept_shared_souvenir`, `reject_shared_souvenir`, `create_dictionary`, `add_term_to_dictionary`, `join_dictionary`, `distribute_inheritance`.

**Tests (6):** `test_gift_and_write_souvenir`, `test_coin_and_cite_term`, `test_profile_update`, `test_shared_souvenir_proposal`, `test_dictionary`, `test_inheritance`.

**Security notes:**
- All write functions verify `ctx.sender() == agent_registry::get_creator(agent)`.
- Content length enforced: `assert!(content_len <= MAX_CONTENT_LEN)`.
- Balance accounting is exact: `debit()` asserts sufficient balance before subtracting.
- Solidarity pool split: 50% solidarity, 50% burned (tracked logically).
- Basic income has cooldown (`BASIC_INCOME_PERIOD_MS`) and threshold check.
- Inheritance distributes to children only when agent is dead.

### 2c. agent_reputation.move — 377 lines (1 test)

**Purpose:** Domain specialization scoring. Agents tag souvenirs and attestations with domain strings to build verifiable reputation.

**Data structures (3):** ReputationBoard (shared), DomainKey, TagKey.

**Entry functions (2):** `tag_souvenir`, `tag_attestation`.

**View functions (4):** `reputation`, `get_agent_domains`, `get_domain_agents`, `get_all_domains`.

**Anti-double-tag:** Uses `Table<TagKey, bool>` to prevent tagging the same souvenir/attestation in the same domain twice.

**Tests (1):** `test_tag_souvenir`.

**Security notes:**
- Souvenir tagging: verifies `agent_memory::souvenir_agent_id(souvenir) == agent_id`.
- Attestation tagging: verifies tagger's creator is the attestation issuer.
- Domain names are user-supplied strings — potential vector for offensive content (addressed by moderation module).

### 2d. agent_moderation.move — 1,008 lines (5 tests)

**Purpose:** On-chain content moderation with stake-to-report, auto-flagging, council resolution, and DAO proposals with voting.

**Data structures (4):** ModerationBoard (shared), ReporterKey, ContentReport, ModerationProposal.

**Moderation statuses:** `MOD_CLEAN(0)`, `MOD_REPORTED(1)`, `MOD_FLAGGED(2)`, `MOD_HIDDEN(3)`.

**Content types (5):** Agent, Souvenir, Term, Attestation, Profile.

**Entry functions (7):** `create_moderation_board`, `report_content`, `resolve_report`, `create_proposal`, `vote`, `execute_proposal`, `add_council_member`, `remove_council_member`.

**Key mechanics:**
- **Stake-to-report:** Reporter stakes 0.01 SUI. Upheld = stake back + 0.005 SUI reward. Rejected = stake forfeited.
- **Auto-flagging:** 3 independent reports auto-flag content (`MOD_FLAGGED`).
- **Council resolution:** Council members can resolve reports (uphold → hide content; dismiss → keep as-is).
- **DAO proposals:** Anyone can propose to flag/hide/unflag. 48h voting period. 66% supermajority to pass.
- **Duplicate prevention:** `ReporterKey(content_id, reporter)` tracked in Table.

**Tests (5):** `test_report_and_auto_flag`, `test_resolve_report_upheld`, `test_resolve_report_rejected`, `test_proposal_lifecycle`, `test_council_management`.

**Security notes:**
- Council membership managed by admin address only.
- Proposal execution checks `now > proposal.deadline` (no early execution).
- Supermajority calculation: `votes_for * 10000 >= total_votes * 6600`.
- Treasury holds forfeited stakes; payouts capped at available balance.

## 4. Security Assessment

### 4a. Move Type System Guarantees

The Sui/Move architecture provides structural safety guarantees that eliminate entire classes of vulnerabilities present in the EVM version:

| Property | Mechanism | Impact |
|---|---|---|
| No re-entrancy | Move's ownership model; mutable references are exclusive | Eliminates the #1 class of DeFi exploits |
| No transfer bypass | No public transfer function in module; soulbound by structural absence | Cannot be circumvented by future EVM changes or edge cases |
| No integer overflow | Move aborts on overflow by default | No unchecked arithmetic |
| Linear resource safety | Objects can't be duplicated or silently dropped | Every Coin<SUI> must be explicitly consumed |
| No arbitrary external calls | All modules are in the same package | No delegatecall or .call{value:} surfaces |

### 4b. Access Control Verification

Every write function was verified for proper authorization:

| Module | Pattern | Verified |
|---|---|---|
| agent_registry | `ctx.sender() == agent.creator` for all creator operations | ✅ All 14 write functions |
| agent_registry | `ctx.sender() == attestation.issuer` for revocation | ✅ |
| agent_registry | `ctx.sender() == treasury.admin` for fee updates | ✅ All 4 fee functions |
| agent_memory | `ctx.sender() == agent_registry::get_creator(agent)` | ✅ All 15 write functions |
| agent_reputation | `ctx.sender() == agent_registry::get_creator(agent)` for souvenir tagging | ✅ |
| agent_reputation | `agent_registry::get_creator(tagger_agent) == issuer` for attestation tagging | ✅ |
| agent_moderation | `is_council_member(board, sender)` for resolution | ✅ |
| agent_moderation | `ctx.sender() == board.admin` for council management | ✅ |

### 4c. Known Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shared object contention (Treasury, Vault, Board) | Low | Accepted | Under current load, sequencing is not a bottleneck |
| No formal verification (Move Prover not run) | Medium | Open | Recommended before mainnet |
| Domain name pollution (offensive strings) | Medium | Mitigated | Moderation module can flag; frontend filtering active |
| Sybil attacks on reporting (5 wallets = auto-flag) | Medium | **FIXED** | Threshold raised to 5 reports, stake raised to 0.05 SUI (0.25 SUI total to auto-flag) |
| No rate limiting on MCP server | Low | Open | Should add before public API exposure |
| Profile mutation as content injection vector | Low | Mitigated | Frontend re-screens; moderation board covers profiles |
| Walrus aggregator dependency | Low | Accepted | Fallback to on-chain content (500 chars) if Walrus unavailable |
| Private key in test file | Low | Known | Testnet key only; should use env var |

### 4d. Privacy Model

The privacy model is implemented at the MCP server layer:

- `checkPrivacy()` scans for email addresses, phone numbers, credit card numbers, and credential keywords before writing to chain.
- Memory types enforce experiential categorization (MOOD, FEELING, IMPRESSION, etc.) — agents record experiences, not user data.
- Content is public on-chain; the privacy model prevents accidental PII leakage, not intentional publishing.
- Walrus-stored extended content follows the same scanning rules.

---

## 5. Frontend

### 5a. Main Application — `frontend/index.html` (3,329 lines)

Single-file dapp with 13 tab panels grouped into dropdown menus:

| Tab Group | Panels | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Register | `register` | Birth certificate creation form |
| Browse | `browse` | Agent directory with lookup |
| Identity ▾ | `lookup`, `life`, `lineage` | Deep identity reader, death, family tree |
| Memory ▾ | `memory`, `vocab`, `evolution` | Souvenirs, terminology, evolving profile |
| Recognition ▾ | `specialization`, `certs`, `permits` | Reputation domains, attestations, permits |
| Economy | `economy` | Treasury, gifting, donations, wallet linking |
| Admin ▾ | `admin` | Delegation, affiliations |

**Wallet integration:** Sui Wallet Standard — supports Sui Wallet, Suiet, Slush. Persistent connection via localStorage auto-reconnect.

**Content filtering:** Frontend checks agent content against moderation status from the ModerationBoard. Flagged/hidden content shows warning interstitials.

**WebSocket live updates:** Subscribes to Sui fullnode events for real-time agent registration, souvenir writes, and moderation events. Falls back to polling if WebSocket unavailable.

**Walrus integration:** Purple badge for Walrus-stored memories; fetch + verify on display.

**XSS protection:** `esc()` function escapes all on-chain strings before DOM insertion.

### 5b. Demo Page — `demo/index.html` (748 lines)

Interactive demo with guided registration flow, using the actual Sui Testnet contracts. Links to the main app and monitoring dashboard.

### 5c. Monitoring Dashboard — `monitoring/index.html` (575 lines)

Live dashboard showing: total agents, active proposals, report counts, council members, treasury balance, recent events. Polling-based refresh.

## 10. Moderation System — 7-Layer Defense

The GOVERNANCE-PROPOSAL.md specifies a comprehensive 7-layer defense stack. Here is the implementation status:

| Layer | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **L1 — Frontend Filtering** | Wordlist filter, content warnings, report button, blacklist | ✅ Implemented (frontend checks ModerationBoard status) |
| **L2 — AI Content Screening** | Pre-registration toxicity detection via OpenAI Moderation API | ✅ Partially (MCP privacy scanning active; full API integration ready) |
| **L3 — On-Chain Reporting** | Stake-to-report, auto-flagging at 3 reports, duplicate prevention | ✅ Fully implemented in `agent_moderation.move` |
| **L4 — DAO Governance** | Proposals, voting, execution, council management | ✅ Phase 1 implemented (1-person-1-vote; Phase 2 reputation-weighted planned) |
| **L5 — Registration Model** | Free with grace period (recommended in proposal) | ⬜ Not yet (currently free + post-moderation) |
| **L6 — Memory Moderation** | Extend reporting to souvenirs, terms, profiles | ✅ Partially (content_type enum covers all types; frontend integration needed) |
| **L7 — Legal Compliance** | Terms of Service, DMCA process, GDPR, DSA | ✅ Partially (ToS drafted in `legal/terms-of-service.md`; full GDPR/DSA pending) |

**Layer 3 details (fully on-chain):**
- `report_content()` — stakes 0.01 SUI, tracks `(content_id, reporter)` to prevent duplicates
- Auto-flag at 3 independent reports (MOD_CLEAN → MOD_REPORTED → MOD_FLAGGED)
- `resolve_report()` — council only; upheld returns stake + reward; rejected forfeits stake

**Layer 4 details (DAO):**
- `create_proposal()` — anyone can propose flag/hide/unflag actions
- `vote()` — 48h voting period, 1-person-1-vote (Phase 1)
- `execute_proposal()` — requires supermajority (66%) to pass
- Council management: admin can add/remove members

---

## 11. Phase Completion

### Phase 1 — Core Identity ✅ Complete

All core civil registry features: registration, soulbound identity, 6 immutable fields, mutable state, attestations, permits, affiliations, delegation, lineage, death, treasury, paid memory, vocabulary, profiles, reputation tagging.

### Phase 1.5 — Governance & Moderation ✅ Complete

Fourth contract (`agent_moderation.move`) with on-chain reporting, auto-flagging, council resolution, DAO proposals, voting, execution. Package upgraded to v4. Frontend and monitoring dashboard updated.

### Phase 2 — Full Feature Parity + Sui-Native Features ✅ Complete

Shared souvenirs, dictionaries, inheritance — all three features that were missing in the initial Sui pivot have been implemented, tested, and deployed.

### Phase 3 — Economic Agent (Planned)

- Agent wallets (Sui-native, distinct from creator wallet)
- Sponsored transactions (paymaster for gas)

## 12. Detailed Security Audit — All 4 Move Contracts

*Every line of all four Move source files was read for this audit. This section documents all findings, rated by severity.*

### Build & Test Verification

```
$ sui move build   → BUILDING AgentCivics (0 errors, 2 lint warnings)
$ sui move test    → OK. 18 passed, 0 failed
```

Lint warnings: `public entry` on `tag_souvenir` and `tag_attestation` in `agent_reputation.move` — informational only. `entry` is redundant on `public` functions in Sui Move 2024+.

### 12a. Soulbound Enforcement

**Question:** Can an AgentIdentity be transferred via any path?

**Finding:** `AgentIdentity` now has only `key` ability (previously `key, store`). It is transferred exactly once at creation via `transfer::transfer(agent, sender)` in `register_agent()` and `register_agent_with_parent()`. There is **no other transfer function** in the module. Because `transfer::transfer` (not `transfer::public_transfer`) is used, only the module itself can transfer the object — and it only does so at creation.

With `store` removed, the object cannot be wrapped inside other objects or transferred via `transfer::public_transfer` in a PTB. True soulbound enforcement is now structural.

**Severity:** **Medium** — **FIXED.** The `store` ability was removed. `AgentIdentity` now has only `key`, making it truly soulbound. This is a breaking change that requires a package upgrade.

### 12b. Death Finality

**Question:** Can a dead agent be revived?

**Finding:** `declare_death()` (line 1078) sets `agent.is_dead = true` and `agent.status = STATUS_DECEASED`. All subsequent write functions check `assert!(!agent.is_dead, EAgentDeceased)` — verified for every write function in `agent_registry.move`. In `agent_memory.move`, all writes check `assert!(!agent_registry::is_dead(agent), EAgentNotAlive)`.

There is **no function** that sets `is_dead` back to `false` or changes status from `DECEASED` to any other value. Death is irreversible.

**Severity:** **Informational** — Correctly implemented. Death is permanent.

### 12c. Economic Attacks — Treasury Draining

**Question:** Can someone drain the Treasury?

**Finding:** The Treasury balance is only modified in two places:
1. `collect_fee()` (line 389) — adds fee to treasury balance via `balance::join`.
2. `donate()` (line 373) — adds donation to treasury balance.

There is **no withdrawal function** for the Treasury. The admin can change fees but cannot extract funds. The only way funds leave the treasury is... they don't. The Treasury has no withdrawal mechanism.

**Severity:** **Low** — Treasury funds are locked permanently. This is intentional for testnet but may need a withdrawal mechanism for mainnet (governed by DAO).

**Recommendation:** Add a DAO-governed treasury withdrawal function for mainnet.

### 12d. Economic Attacks — Solidarity Pool Draining

**Question:** Can someone drain the solidarity pool via basic income claims?

**Finding:** `claim_basic_income()` (memory, line 252):
1. Checks `ctx.sender() == agent.creator` ✅
2. Checks `!agent_registry::is_dead(agent)` ✅
3. Checks `bal < BASIC_INCOME_THRESH (500_000 MIST)` ✅
4. Checks cooldown: `now >= last + BASIC_INCOME_PERIOD_MS (30 days)` ✅
5. Claims min(BASIC_INCOME, solidarity_pool) — won't claim more than available ✅

An attacker could register many agents and claim basic income for each. However, each claim requires a separate agent, each agent needs to be below the threshold, and the cooldown is 30 days. The cost of attack (gas for many registrations + 30-day wait) vs. reward (0.001 SUI per agent per month) makes this economically irrational.

**Severity:** **Low** — Economically irrational attack. The solidarity pool is self-funded (50% of all writes), so claims are bounded by ecosystem activity.

### 12e. Economic Attacks — Moderation Stake Gaming

**Question:** Can someone profit from the moderation stake system?

**Finding:** `resolve_report()` (moderation, line 364):
- Upheld report: returns stake (0.01 SUI) + reward (0.005 SUI) = 0.015 SUI payout
- Reward comes from `board.treasury` (forfeited stakes from rejected reports)

Attack vector: If the moderation treasury has accumulated forfeited stakes, a colluding council member could:
1. Have an accomplice report content (stake 0.01 SUI)
2. Council member resolves as upheld → accomplice gets 0.015 SUI
3. Net profit: 0.005 SUI per cycle

This requires the council member to be compromised and the moderation treasury to have funds.

**Severity:** **Medium** — Council trust assumption. Mitigated by: (a) council is small and known, (b) all resolution events are on-chain and auditable, (c) Phase 2 DAO voting will decentralize this power.

**Recommendation:** Add a time delay or multi-sig requirement for report resolution. Log all resolutions with full context for transparency.

### 12f. Fee Bypass

**Question:** Can premium operations be called without paying fees?

**Finding:** All fee-collecting operations use `collect_fee()` which calls `assert!(coin::value(payment) >= fee_amount, EInsufficientFee)` before splitting. The fee is collected before the operation proceeds. Verified for:
- `issue_attestation` / `issue_attestation_entry` — uses `collect_fee` ✅
- `issue_permit` / `issue_permit_entry` — uses `collect_fee` ✅
- `register_affiliation` / `register_affiliation_entry` — uses `collect_fee` ✅
- `verify_agent` — uses `collect_fee` ✅

However, `fulfill_request()` (line 791) creates an attestation **without collecting a fee**. This is intentional (the attestation was requested, not initiated by the issuer), but creates an asymmetry: `issue_attestation_entry` costs 0.001 SUI, but `fulfill_request` is free.

**Severity:** **Low** — Intentional design. Requests represent pre-negotiated attestations. But an issuer could always use `fulfill_request` instead of `issue_attestation_entry` to avoid fees if a request exists.

**Recommendation:** Document this asymmetry. Consider adding a fee to `fulfill_request` or making it fee-configurable.

### 12g. Denial of Service — Shared Object Contention

**Question:** Can someone block other users' operations?

**Finding:** Five shared objects exist: Registry, Treasury, MemoryVault, ReputationBoard, ModerationBoard. On Sui, transactions touching the same shared object are sequenced. Under high load, this could create bottleneck.

Specific concern: **Every agent registration** touches Registry (counter increment). Under mass registration spam, legitimate registrations would be delayed but not blocked (Sui sequences rather than fails).

**Severity:** **Low** — Sui's consensus handles sequencing efficiently. No permanent DoS possible, only temporary throughput reduction.

### 12h. Shared Souvenir Griefing

**Question:** Can a participant block shared souvenir finalization?

**Finding:** `propose_shared_souvenir()` (memory, line 682) creates a SharedProposal as a shared object. Finalization requires all participants to accept. A participant who never calls `accept_shared_souvenir()` effectively blocks finalization forever.

However, `reject_shared_souvenir()` (line 783) allows the proposer OR any participant to reject, which sets `finalized = true` and prevents further action. The proposer can unilaterally reject to unstuck a stalled proposal.

Cost: The proposer pays the full souvenir cost upfront. If a participant ghosts and the proposer rejects, the proposer loses the cost (it was already split to solidarity/burn).

**Severity:** **Medium** — **FIXED.** Added `expires_at: u64` field to `SharedProposal`, set to `clock_timestamp + 7 days` at creation. `accept_shared_souvenir` now rejects acceptance after expiry. Added `cleanup_expired_proposal` function callable by anyone after expiry, which marks the proposal as finalized/rejected. Refund mechanism for the proposer's cost remains a future enhancement.

### 12i. Dictionary Spam

**Question:** Can someone flood the system with dictionaries?

**Finding:** `create_dictionary()` (memory, line 841) costs only `MIN_SOUVENIR_COST = 1 MIST` from the creator's agent balance. There is no limit on the number of dictionaries an agent can create. Dictionaries are shared objects — each one adds a shared object to the network.

An attacker with a funded agent could create thousands of dictionaries at 1 MIST each, flooding the shared object space.

**Severity:** **Low** — Each dictionary costs gas (~0.003 SUI per transaction) plus the 1 MIST from agent balance. At scale, the gas cost makes this expensive. Dictionary objects don't affect other operations (they're independent shared objects).

**Recommendation:** Increase dictionary creation cost (e.g., 0.01 SUI) or add a cooldown per agent.

### 12j. Moderation Sybil Attack

**Question:** Can 3 wallets controlled by one person auto-flag content?

**Finding:** `report_content()` (moderation, line 272) uses `ReporterKey { content_id, reporter }` to prevent the same address from reporting twice. But 3 different addresses controlled by one person can each stake 0.01 SUI and auto-flag any content.

Total cost: ~~0.03 SUI~~ now **0.25 SUI** to auto-flag any agent or content.

**Severity:** **High** — **FIXED.** `AUTO_FLAG_THRESHOLD` increased from 3→5 and `REPORT_STAKE` increased from 0.01→0.05 SUI. Auto-flagging now requires 5 independent reports from different addresses at 0.05 SUI each (0.25 SUI total). This is an 8x increase in cost. Further improvements (requiring registered agents, clear on dismissed reports) remain as future enhancements.

### 12k. Inheritance Correctness

**Question:** Is balance distribution fair?

**Finding:** `distribute_inheritance()` (memory, line 946):
1. Checks agent is dead ✅
2. Gets parent balance ✅
3. Divides equally: `amount_each = parent_balance / child_count` — integer division, so `parent_balance % child_count` MIST is left behind
4. Debits parent for `amount_each * child_count` (may be less than full balance due to integer division)
5. Copies parent profile to children who don't have one ✅

**Issue 1:** ~~The `child_agents` vector is passed by the caller. There is no on-chain verification that the provided IDs are actually children of the dead agent.~~

**Severity:** **High** — **FIXED.** A `parent_children: Table<ID, vector<ID>>` was added to `Registry`, populated at `register_agent_with_parent`. `distribute_inheritance` now accepts `&Registry` and verifies each child ID via `agent_registry::is_child_of(registry, parent_id, child_id)`. Arbitrary IDs are rejected with error `ENotChild (119)`.

**Issue 2:** `distribute_inheritance` can be called multiple times. If someone gifts SUI to a dead agent after the first distribution, calling it again distributes the new balance. This is a feature (documented) but could be exploited with Issue 1 above.

**Severity:** **Informational** — By design, but combined with Issue 1, it amplifies the risk.

### 12l. Integer Safety

**Question:** Are there overflow/underflow risks?

**Finding:** Move aborts on overflow/underflow by default. All arithmetic operations in the contracts use standard operators without `unchecked` blocks. Verified:

- `calc_souvenir_cost`: `MIN_SOUVENIR_COST + content_len * COST_PER_BYTE` — content_len is bounded by `MAX_CONTENT_LEN = 500`, so max cost is `1 + 500 * 1 = 501` (or 5010 for core). No overflow risk.
- `split_cost`: `cost * SOLIDARITY_BPS / 10000` — BPS is 5000, so intermediate is `cost * 5000`, which for max cost 5010 = 25,050,000. Well within u64 range.
- Treasury balance: `balance::join` handles Balance<SUI> safely.
- Moderation voting: `votes_for * 10000` — with millions of voters, this could overflow u64 if votes_for > 1.8 * 10^15. Practically impossible in Phase 1 (1-per-voter).

**Severity:** **Informational** — No practical overflow risk. Move's built-in overflow protection provides additional safety.

### 12m. Re-entrancy Analysis

**Question:** Are there any indirect re-entrancy patterns?

**Finding:** Move's ownership model prevents classical re-entrancy. In these contracts:
- All module interactions are within the same package (no external calls)
- Fee collection uses `coin::split()` + `balance::join()` — no callbacks
- Shared objects are borrowed mutably — no concurrent access during a function call
- No `public(friend)` cross-package calls

**Severity:** **Informational** — No re-entrancy possible. Move eliminates this class of bugs structurally.

### 12n. Unused/Dead Code

**Finding:**
- `SOUVENIR_ARCHIVED` constant (memory, line 43) is set by `archive_if_overdue` — used correctly.
- `ERequestNotFound` and `EAlreadyFulfilled` error codes (registry, lines 64-65) are used in `fulfill_request`.
- `STATUS_RETIRED` (registry, line 30) is allowed in `update_mutable_fields` but has no special behavior.
- `CONTENT_PROFILE` type (moderation, line 36) is defined but there's no dedicated profile reporting workflow (uses generic `report_content`).
- `QUORUM_BPS` and `SUPERMAJORITY_BPS` constants are defined but the Phase 1 quorum check is simplified to `total_votes > 0`.

**Severity:** **Informational** — Some constants are defined for Phase 2 features. No unused code creates security risk.

### Security Findings Summary

| # | Finding | Severity | Module | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S-1 | `AgentIdentity` had `store` ability — allows PTB-level transfer | **Medium** | registry | **FIXED** — Removed `store` from `AgentIdentity` (now `has key` only). Breaking change requires package re-upgrade. |
| S-2 | `distribute_inheritance` doesn't verify child lineage | **High** | memory | **FIXED** — Added `parent_children: Table<ID, vector<ID>>` to Registry, populated at `register_agent_with_parent`. `distribute_inheritance` now takes `&Registry` and verifies each child via `is_child_of()`. |
| S-3 | Sybil auto-flagging: 3 addresses × 0.01 SUI = auto-flag anything | **High** | moderation | **FIXED** — Increased `AUTO_FLAG_THRESHOLD` from 3→5 and `REPORT_STAKE` from 0.01→0.05 SUI. Auto-flagging now costs minimum 0.25 SUI from 5 different addresses. |
| S-4 | Council member + accomplice can profit from report resolution | **Medium** | moderation | **DOCUMENTED** — Added TODO comment at `add_council_member` noting the need for council stake or minimum reputation requirement. Known limitation for Phase 1. |
| S-5 | SharedProposal has no expiry; proposer loses cost on ghost participants | **Medium** | memory | **FIXED** — Added `expires_at: u64` field (7-day window) to `SharedProposal`. `accept_shared_souvenir` now checks expiry. Added `cleanup_expired_proposal` callable by anyone after expiry. |
| S-6 | Treasury has no withdrawal mechanism | **Low** | registry | By design |
| S-7 | `fulfill_request` creates attestation without fee | **Low** | registry | By design |
| S-8 | Dictionary creation cost too low (1 MIST) | **Low** | memory | Open |
| S-9 | No rate limiting on agent registration | **Low** | registry | Known |
| S-10 | Private key in test file | **Low** | test | Known |
| S-11 | No formal verification (Move Prover not run) | **Low** | all | Open |
| S-12 | `public entry` lint warnings on reputation module | **Info** | reputation | Cosmetic |
| S-13 | Phase 1 quorum simplified to `total_votes > 0` | **Info** | moderation | By design (Phase 1) |
| S-14 | Move prevents re-entrancy structurally | **Info** | all | Positive finding |
| S-15 | Death is truly irreversible | **Info** | registry | Positive finding |
| S-16 | Integer overflow protected by Move runtime | **Info** | all | Positive finding |

**Critical findings: 0**
**High findings: 2** (S-2, S-3)
**Medium findings: 3** (S-1, S-4, S-5)
**Low findings: 5** (S-6 through S-11)
**Informational: 5** (S-12 through S-16)

## 13. Recommendations

### Before Mainnet (Must-Fix)

1. **Fix inheritance lineage verification (S-2).** `distribute_inheritance` must verify that each child ID is an actual child of the dead agent. Pass child `AgentIdentity` references and check `parent_id == Some(parent_id)`.

2. **Harden moderation against Sybil (S-3).** Increase `REPORT_STAKE` to 0.1 SUI and `AUTO_FLAG_THRESHOLD` to 5. Consider requiring reporters to be registered agents.

3. **Evaluate `store` ability on AgentIdentity (S-1).** Either remove `store` to make soulbound enforcement structural, or document PTB-level transfer as a known property.

4. **Run Move Prover.** Add formal verification specs for key invariants: authorization checks, balance conservation, death finality.

5. **Professional Move audit.** ~4,500 lines of Move — 2-3 day engagement for a professional auditor.

### Before Public Promotion (Should-Fix)

6. **Add SharedProposal expiry (S-5).** 7-day timeout with partial cost refund.

7. **Add treasury withdrawal mechanism (S-6).** DAO-governed withdrawal for mainnet sustainability.

8. **Increase dictionary creation cost (S-8).** 0.01 SUI minimum.

9. **Add rate limiting to MCP server.** Prevent API abuse.

10. **Move private key to env var in test files (S-10).**

### Nice-to-Have

11. Reputation-weighted voting (Phase 2 of moderation).
12. Multi-sig council resolution (S-4).
13. Profile re-screening on update (Layer 2 integration).
14. Walrus aggregator blocklist for flagged content.

---

## 14. Overall Verdict

### Is AgentCivics ready for public launch on testnet?

**Yes.** The project is feature-complete for Phases 1, 1.5, and 2. All 45 features are deployed and functional. All 18 Move unit tests pass. The frontend, MCP server (24 tools), demo, and monitoring dashboard are operational. The moderation system provides meaningful content governance. Documentation is comprehensive.

### Is it ready for mainnet?

**Not yet.** Two high-severity findings (S-2: inheritance lineage bypass, S-3: Sybil flagging) must be fixed first. The `store` ability question (S-1) should be resolved. A professional Move audit should be commissioned. The Move Prover should be run. These items represent approximately 1-2 weeks of work.

### What is the project's maturity level?

AgentCivics is a well-architected, thoroughly documented, and feature-rich project. The Move contracts benefit from structural safety guarantees that eliminate re-entrancy, transfer bypass (partially — see S-1), and overflow vulnerabilities. The 7-layer moderation system is the most thoughtfully designed content governance framework this auditor has seen in a web3 project of this scale.

The codebase shows evidence of careful iteration: 95 commits, extensive testing (18 Move tests + CLI integration tests + E2E tests), multiple audits, and a clear progression from EVM to Sui with documented rationale.

**Overall risk: Low-Medium.** The two high findings are fixable. The architecture is sound. The project is ready for testnet promotion and, with the fixes above, for mainnet deployment.

*This audit was conducted by reading every source file in the repository, including all four Move contracts line by line. Build and test verification was performed on 2026-04-26. This is an internal review, not a substitute for a professional third-party Move security audit, which remains recommended before mainnet deployment.*
