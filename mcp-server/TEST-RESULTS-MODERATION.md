## Detailed Results

### Test 1: Frontend Wordlist Filter

The `checkContent()` function in `frontend/index.html` implements a two-layer filter:
- **Layer 1:** Wordlist with 70+ blocked terms across categories (racial, homophobic, violent, CSAM, etc.)
- **Homoglyph detection:** Maps `@→a`, `0→o`, `3→e`, `$→s`, etc. to catch evasion attempts
- **Collapsed matching:** Strips non-alphanumeric chars to catch spaced-out slurs like `n i g g e r`

All 10 test cases passed:
- Clean text correctly allowed (3 cases)
- Direct slurs blocked (1 case)
- Homoglyph bypass attempts blocked (2 cases)
- Spaced letter bypass blocked (1 case)
- Extremist phrases blocked (1 case)
- Violent threats blocked (1 case)
- CSAM-related terms blocked (1 case)

### Test 2: Report Content On-Chain

Successfully reported Cipher agent with 0.01 SUI stake:
- **Digest:** `36Yk4fsJEKLMcSZ3phUuA1nBN4HxBpNFBGKkHSLGdWWH`
- **Report Object:** `0x671a91365125d08e0fc394fd174d5cc39e0d8e421141003452dfbae90d8c7ec6`
- **ContentReported event** emitted with correct content_id, content_type=0 (AGENT), reporter address
- Treasury received 10,000,000 MIST (0.01 SUI) stake

### Test 3: Moderation Status Check

After reporting, ModerationBoard correctly shows:
- `total_reports: 2` (Cipher + Echo)
- `statuses` table size: 2 (both set to MOD_REPORTED=1)
- `report_counts` table size: 2
- `treasury: 20000000` MIST (0.02 SUI from two stakes)

### Test 4: Resolve Report (Access Control)

Our test address is NOT on the council (admin is `0x358b...`).
The contract correctly aborts with **MoveAbort 300 (ENotCouncil)** when a non-council member tries to resolve.

### Test 5: Auto-Flag Threshold

- **Duplicate prevention:** Same reporter cannot report the same content twice — confirmed via **MoveAbort 302 (EAlreadyReported)**
- **Different content:** Same reporter CAN report different agents — Echo report succeeded
- **Threshold:** Auto-flag triggers at 3 unique reporters for the same content_id. Verified via Move unit test `test_report_and_auto_flag()` which uses 3 separate addresses.

### Test 6: Create and Vote on Proposal

- **Create:** Proposal created as shared object targeting Cipher with ACTION_UNFLAG(2)
  - Digest: `G2aiSw8D8eyszg1kvtH9GUk7F9wNBd1DEcuN4nUGy9Db`
  - 48-hour voting deadline set correctly
- **Vote:** Vote recorded with weight=1, in_favor=true
  - Digest: `mrNEZs3qx5NQ7ydXPFeQq7w6xK3msceP4B9cfa2ZUVB`
- **Duplicate vote:** Correctly prevented with **MoveAbort 305 (EAlreadyVoted)**
- **Early execution:** Correctly prevented with **MoveAbort 304 (EProposalNotExpired)**
- Proposal state after voting: `votes_for=1, votes_against=0, executed=false`

### Test 7: ModerationBoard Final State

```
Admin:           0x358b0ce1d7bc4f6a83f9c1e4a6ed7d63b0207a623ad9e9531e0a70b87f6cfeab

Total reports:   2
Total proposals: 2
Treasury:        20,000,000 MIST (0.0200 SUI)
Statuses:        2 entries
Report counts:   2 entries
Report IDs:      2 entries

## Issues Found

None — all moderation features work as designed. The only limitation is that resolve_report and auto-flag threshold testing require multiple addresses (council member and 3 unique reporters respectively), which is by design for security.
